<!--
ROS params are really useful to launch your ROS application with 
different setup settings, without having to re-write and re-compile 
any part of your code. With the rosparam command line tool, youâ€™ll
be able to test your programs even faster when developing.
-->

<launch>
    <param name="my_integer" type="int" value="7" />
    <param name="my_float" type="double" value="3.14" />
    <param name="my_string" type="str" value="hello" />
</launch>

<!-- These parameters are in global namespace. If we want
to use parameters within specific namespace then syntax is 
as follows
<param name="/name_space/my_integer" type="int" value="7" />

we can read, edit, add or delete params in command line
rosparam list
rosparam get /myfloat
rosparam set /myfloat 0.3
rosparam delete /my_float
rosparam set /new_param 20
